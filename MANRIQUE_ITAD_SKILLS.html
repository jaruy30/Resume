<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was growing up I tend to enjoy <strong>tinkering</strong> with objects.<sup>1</sup> I was eager to so <strong>solve and find out how a device works</strong> if I didn’t find out its function it would boggle my mind for many days.<sup>2</sup> This is where my curiosity of day to day gadgets started.<sup>3</sup> I would find old unneeded gadgets and open them so that I could inspect how they function.<sup>3</sup> Later on, I dared to experiment with digital gadgets and how pressing the icons would do a certain function.<sup>4</sup> This later honed my skills in <strong>fixing or troubleshooting devices</strong> within my home.<sup>5</sup> I was always the one tasked to find solutions to their problems on their devices.<sup>6</sup><br><br>
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I was only watching YouTube guides because I didn’t know the terms and what to do if a certain problem occurred.<sup>7</sup> Now I can easily fix problems on electronic devices especially <strong>mobile devices</strong> since it was the first device I started on.<sup>8</sup> I tend to experiment with how the settings change the function and interface of the device.<sup>9</sup> I would not stop <strong>experimenting</strong> until I find a solution to my problem because I find it a hindrance if there are problems consistently occurring on my way.<sup>10</sup> After the pandemic occurred I was given a <strong>laptop</strong> for my online studies.<sup>11</sup> This made me realize that computers are also interesting in their own way.<sup>12</sup><br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That computers are more complex than mobile devices and there are many functions that I still didn’t know.<sup>13</sup> With this in mind, when my laptop faces problems I would look for a solution on the internet so I can fix it without going to repair shops.<sup>14</sup> This also honed my skill to troubleshoot and easily recognize problems on my device so that I can easily fix them.<sup>15</sup> This is why I believe my main skills are <strong>adaptability and persistence</strong> because, in the face of obstacles, I always try to find solutions.<sup>16</sup> I have come to appreciate the challenges that come with technology, as they provide constant opportunities for <strong>learning and growth</strong>.<sup>17</sup> Every problem I encounter becomes a chance to enhance my understanding and expertise.<sup>18</sup> I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into a <strong>urious and capable individual</strong> in the field of technology.<sup>19</sup> I am still excited to continue exploring new knowledge and expanding my skills in this ever-evolving field.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

<h2 class="title"><dd><li>My Hobbies</li></dd></h2>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I have lots of fun hobbies that I enjoy.<sup>1</sup> One thing I love to do is play <strong>badminton</strong>.<sup>2</sup> It's like tennis but with a smaller racket and a shuttlecock instead of a ball.<sup>3</sup> I enjoy the feeling of getting to move freely while playing with an opponent.<sup>4</sup> As I was growing up, my parents told me I was very active when it came to playing outside.<sup>5</sup> Maybe it is the reason why I still enjoy doing <strong>adrenaline-inducing sports</strong>.<sup>6</sup><br><br>
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I play badminton, I move around a lot and it helps me stay in good shape.<sup>7</sup> I feel a sense of <strong>freedom and thrill</strong> as I move across the court, chasing after the shuttlecock not knowing whether I will score a point or not.<sup>8</sup> Sometimes, I also practice <strong>boxing</strong> at home.<sup>9</sup> I don't fight anyone I only punch the wall punching bag I bought and do exercises to get stronger and learn how to punch.<sup>10</sup> I feel <strong>empowered and determined</strong> as I practice different punches and footwork drills.<sup>11</sup> It's a good way to let out any stress I might be feeling.<sup>12</sup><br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I also do <strong>weight lifting and cardio exercises</strong> at gyms with my friends during my free time.<sup>13</sup> When I want to relax and use my imagination, I <strong>read books</strong> such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones.<sup>14</sup> I love getting lost in a good story and picturing all the characters and places in my head because it also improves my imagination.<sup>15</sup> And if I'm not in the mood to read, I <strong>watch anime</strong>.<sup>16</sup> Anime is like cartoons from Japan, and they often have really interesting stories and characters.<sup>17</sup> These hobbies make me happy and keep me entertained when I'm not busy with other things.<sup>18</sup> I also like to <strong>listen to music</strong> while I'm doing my hobbies; it sets a nice mood and keeps me motivated.<sup>19</sup> Besides badminton, boxing, reading, and watching anime, I also enjoy <strong>spending time with my friends and family</strong>.<sup>20</sup> They make everything more enjoyable because I can feel and show love towards others.<sup>21</sup></p></blockquote>

<h2 class="title"><dd><li>My Interests</li></dd></h2>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always been fascinated by <strong>computer hardware and graphics design</strong>.<sup>1</sup> Understanding how components work together to create stunning visuals of digital art.<sup>2</sup> <strong>Graphic design</strong> also allows me to show my creativity and turn ideas into reality; every project is a new opportunity to learn and grow.<sup>3</sup> When I delve into computer hardware, I feel <strong>excited and curious</strong> as I explore the functions of processors, graphics cards, and memory modules.<sup>4</sup> <strong>Cooking</strong> is another passion of mine that I am still learning, experimenting with flavors and techniques in the kitchen is both creative and satisfying.<sup>5</sup><br><br> 
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find peace and comfort in crafting delicious meals especially when my family and friends enjoy the food I make.<sup>6</sup> Recently, I've taken up learning the <strong>ukulele</strong>, and I'm enjoying the challenge of mastering chords and melodies to express myself while accompanying them with vocal songs.<sup>7</sup> I am interested in learning many songs on the ukulele that I can sing so that I can soothe myself and the people around me.<sup>8</sup> I've also gotten into <strong>learning Spanish</strong> by reading books about the language.<sup>9</sup> I was always fascinated by how it would feel to speak a language that you have never understood.<sup>10</sup> Each of these interests fills my appetite for new knowledge because I want to improve and learn new things daily.<sup>11</sup></p></blockquote>
