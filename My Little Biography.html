        <h2 class="title"><dd>Childhood Years</dd></h2>

        <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born on <strong>June 17, 2004</strong>, in <strong>San Andres, Manila</strong>, and later moved to <strong>Dasmariñas Cavite</strong>.<sup>1</sup>
        During my early years, my parents discovered that I could already learn and talk clearly at the age of
        2; they were ecstatic when they heard my first word, which was “papa”.<sup>2</sup> Turning 4, my parents shared
        that I already wanted to go to school since our house was beside a kindergarten school.<sup>3</sup> I was
        fascinated by how the older kids wore uniforms, carried colorful bags, and played with friends.<sup>4</sup>
        Therefore, my parents asked the kindergarten head if I could try joining one day of class to see if I
        liked studying.<sup>5</sup> On my first day, I cried because I thought my parents were leaving me, but they
        assured me they would wait outside to stop my tears.<sup>6</sup><br><br> Looking back, I believe they left me there and
        went home because I didn’t see them outside during our recess break.<sup>7</sup> Gradually, I learned to make
        friends, and enjoy my classes, and the teachers noted that I was eager to learn but very playful.<sup>8</sup> I
        made many friends at school, but there were four classmates I was very close to, sharing everything;
        sadly, I don’t know where they are now.<sup>9</sup> We always played after school since our houses were close
        by, which is why I know many outdoor games and remain athletic to this day.<sup>10</sup> I also remember having
        a crush on someone in my class; she was quiet and pretty, which is perhaps why I liked her back
        then.<sup>11</sup> I tried to get her attention by being playful, but she was always so shy, preventing me from
        getting close and playing with her.<sup>12</sup><br><br> Later on, I had a childhood enemy, but I can’t recall how I felt back
        then; I only remember that we would get into arguments about our toys and games, comparing which
        was better.<sup>13</sup> Later in my childhood, I saw my parents play a game I hadn't seen before called
        <strong>"Badminton"</strong>.<sup>14</sup> Thrilled to see both of them playing while hitting an object in the air alternately, I tried to
        copy them using a stick and a ball but found it hard to replicate.<sup>15</sup> I asked them to teach me how to
        play, and I was very happy when they agreed and bought me my racket.<sup>16</sup> Because of this experience I learned to love and enjoy the sport badminton.<sup>17</sup>My parents enrolled into badminton training so I can hone my skills on this sport.<sup>18</sup>I also joined badminton clubs in my school so I can play badminton during my freetime or club days.<sup>19</sup>Later on I started to compete during sports festivals and Intramurals, luckily I won the <strong>"Champion""</strong> title during my highschool days.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

        <h2 class="title"> <dd>Teenage Years</dd></h2>
        <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, we moved back to <strong>Pandacan Manila</strong>, where my grandparents live to this day.<sup>1</sup> After
        settling, my parents decided I needed to enroll in a new school so I wouldn't fall behind in my studies.<sup>2</sup>
        I took the entrance exam, and thankfully, I passed with perfect scores.<sup>3</sup> I began studying at <strong>"Paco
        Catholic School"</strong>, where I stayed for <strong>12 years</strong> until I graduated.<sup>4</sup> I had many good and bad experiences
        during high school, learning numerous things that shaped who I am today.<sup>5</sup> I didn’t enjoy my high
        school days much because people tended to avoid me due to my reputation as toxic towards others.<sup>6</sup><br><br>
        I hated myself back then, so I accepted the reputation and started to embody the rumors, leading me
        to hate myself more.<sup>7</sup> Soon, I met new friends who shared my hobbies and interests. From that point
        on, I wanted to be better for them and for myself.<sup>8</sup> Slowly, I tried to improve myself to avoid
        disappointing them, making me happy because I learned to be better.<sup>9</sup> Unfortunately, all my progress
        halted when my grandmother, who provided knowledge when I was younger, passed away.<sup>10</sup>
        Devastated, I almost let my academics go to waste; my friends avoided me due to my bad attitude,
        and my grades plummeted, making my parents angry.<sup>11</sup> I felt alone and wanted it all to end, believing
        that leaving the world behind would be the only solution to the pain.<sup>12</sup><br><br> One night, I tried to end it all, but
        luckily, I stopped myself, thinking of the people who would be devastated if I were gone.<sup>13</sup> Slowly, I tried
        to stand up once again because <strong>I also wanted to see the future</strong>.<sup>14</sup> I gave myself the courage to fight all
        my problems head-on without regretting the negative things that happened.<sup>15</sup> After everything, I began
        to feel satisfied and happy with what I had become.<sup>16</sup> I returned to my hobbies and what I loved while
        learning new skills to become better than yesterday.<sup>17</sup> I promised not to let myself go down that path
        again because, right now, I’m still learning to love what I have become.<sup>18</sup>I learned enjoy everything around me even if it may give me hardships, because I realized that life will always be hard.<sup>19</sup>It will be up to us how we handle the situations we face, thus I believe we should just enjoy the ride of life.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

        <h2 class="title"> <dd>College Years</dd></h2>
        <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering college, I applied to many universities to secure a college to attend. Thankfully,
        I was accepted by many colleges, but they didn’t offer the courses I wanted.<sup>1</sup> My final choice was going
        to <strong>“University of the East”</strong>.<sup>2</sup> Initially, I was anxious about starting college since this stage would be
        a major part of my life.<sup>3</sup> Since it was still post-pandemic, I spent my 1st semester through online
        classes, challenging for me because it made me lazy.<sup>4</sup> Despite all my classmates being far from each
        other, I made friends with them, especially the boys in my class since we could all relate to each
        other.<sup>5</sup> We all helped each other, particularly in groupings and activities where some understood what
        to do and could help those who didn’t grasp the lessons.<sup>6</sup><br><br> As time passed, we began attending classes
        on campus, making me nervous because the online setup differed significantly from the face-to-face
        setup.<sup>7</sup> On our first day, we enjoyed ourselves, physically meeting friends we hadn’t seen for almost
        three years. With this in mind, I learned new things about my course and met new friends who are
        currently precious to me.<sup>8</sup> I adapted to the new setup and am still trying to learn more for a better
        future.<sup>9</sup> I also made new enemies that hindered my progress and caused hardships, but I don’t mind
        them as much as possible because I prioritize academics and friends who are crucial to me.<sup>10</sup> Slowly
        and steadily, I am still trying to learn more, as I need it for the future.<sup>11</sup> The connections and friendships
        I make can also be very beneficial.<sup>12</sup><br><br> With this in mind, I am currently enjoying my college years, even
        with piled-up activities that make me want to give up.<sup>13</sup> Still, I push on because I know it will be worth it
        in the future. I believe a better mindset and patience can make everything better in time.<sup>14</sup>Because I know that everything will become better if we wait.<sup>13</sup><strong>Time will heal all wounds</strong> if we take our time to process the pain we felt in life.<sup>14</sup>During my college years I am still trying to become better and improve my honesty, because there will always be temptations to face.<sup>15</sup> I tend to enjoy the course that I have chosen because I have friends that support and help me to become better.</sup>16</sup>Though there are many hardships that we need to get past through, we always try to overcome it because we need to.<sup>17</sup> <strong>Improving myself while learning is my utmost priority</strong> so that I will be prepared when I graduate and face the real world.<sup>18</sup>I realized that friends and family members will support you during your hardships and will help cheer you up when you feel down.<sup>19</sup>This is why <strong>I am thankful for everything that I have experienced<strong>.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
